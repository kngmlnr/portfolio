          01. Artistic frontend developer eager for knowledge
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph_text">
          Hi again! My name is Kinga Molnár. I'm originally from Hungary, but I
          lived across Europe in the last 5 years. Currently I'm living in
          Aarhus and I study at Business Academy Aarhus. I had always two sides:
          the logical nerd and the artistic soul. I was working in a scientific
          center as a guide about physics and chemistry, I built furnitures and
          I wrote my Bachelor thesis about privacy and data protection. In the
          meanwhile I played piano, started to paint and had a big passion about
          photography. I never knew how could I combine all of this, until I
          found the Multimedia Design program.
          <br /><br />
          Nowadays I'm also volunteering in a non-profit organization connected
          with Erasmus+, as a digital designer and project manager assistant.
          <br /><br />
          Now my biggest goal is to be a valuable member of a great team where I
          can contribute with my knowledge and where I can further develop my
          skills every day.

              I'm working in different projects with a team or on my own, to
              create digital solutions. In this program we learned the whole

              often with real clients who needed our help to design and develop
              a digital solution for an existing problem.

              In Budapest I was studying law, politics, economic, sociology,

              finish a higher education, and I managed to find a small piece
              that I was passionate about. During the years I was an IT
              demonstrator who helped the professor during classes and exams,
              and at the end of my studies I wrote my thesis in the IT Faculty.

                    in Aarhus. We have created a website for him, where we used

          I'm searching for an internship, where I can make a good use of my
          design and coding knowledge and I can also develop myself. I would
          like to be part of a great team, where we work together in order to
          create something that we can be proud of.
